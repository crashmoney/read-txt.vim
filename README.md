# read-txt.vim

A lightweight Vim plugin for syntax-highlighting my `read.txt` file.

## Syntax

- series name and number in square brackets
- title and author separated by an em-dash (`option + -` on MacOS)
- date read enclosed in parenthesis
- ownership status at the end of the line
    - `#`: borrowed, from a friend or library
    - `+`: owned

All together, it looks something like:

`[The Hunger Games 1] The Hunger Games â€“ Suzanne Collins (2024-03-14)#`
